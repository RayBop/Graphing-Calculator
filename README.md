      Plot twist is a python program that has the functionality of a graphing calculator. It has Cartesian, parametric, polar, and statistics modes and can read a variety of functions including but not limited to trig, inverse trig, log, and power functions. It can calculate derivatives as well (not approximations but the actual derivative) and graph intersections and intercepts of and between functions. The only module used for the program is tkinter so additional download is not necessary. The three files to run the program are Terms.py, Statistics.py, and GraphingCalculator_GUI.py. Run the last file to run the main program.
